# Data Analysis

A flow cytometer detects the fluorescence signal from cells that are flowing past a laser-detector. The data is arriving at regular intervals. Often, these cells are encapsulated within droplets  and the task is to identify 

the location (record number) of  droplet and the width of the droplet
the mean arrival time, and its std dev, between droplets
The data file has 2 columns of data

column one: forward scatter (noisier, simple photodetector)<br>
column two: side scatter (cleaner, sensitive photomultiplier tube)
